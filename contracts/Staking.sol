 * @title Staking contract
 *
 * @author Bryant Eisenbach
 * @author Reuven Etzion
 *
 * Curator Requirements
 * @req c01 Any User can stake Graph Tokens to be included as a Curator for a given subgraphId.
 * @req c02 The amount of tokens to stake required to become a Curator must be greater than or
 *          equal to the minimum curation staking amount.
 * @req c03 Only Governance can change the minimum curation staking amount.
 * @req c04 A Curator is issued shares according to a pre-defined bonding curve depending on
 *          equal to the total amount of Curation stake for a given subgraphId if they
 *          successfully stake on a given subgraphId.
 * @req c05 A Curator can add any amount of stake for a given subgraphId at any time, as long
 *          as their total amount remains more than minimumCurationStakingAmount.
 * @req c06 A Curator can remove any amount of their stake for a given subgraphId at any time,
 *          as long as their total amount remains more than minimumCurationStakingAmount.
 * @req c07 A Curator can remove all of their stake for a given subgraphId at any time.
 * @req c08 Curation shares accrue 1 basis point per share of any fees an Indexing Node would
 *          earn when a channel settlement occurs for a given subgraphId.
 *
 * Indexer Requirements
 * @req i01 Any User can stake Graph Tokens to be included as an Indexer for a given subgraphId.
 * @req i02 The amount of tokens to stake required to become an Indexer must be greater than or
 *          equal to the minimum indexing staking amount.
 * @req i03 Only Governance can change the minimum indexing staking amount.
 * @req i04 An Indexer can start the process of removing their stake for a given subgraphId at
 *          any time.
 * @req i05 An Indexer may withdraw their stake for a given subgraphId after the process has
 *          been started and a thawing period has elapsed.
 * @req i06 An Indexer can add any amount of stake for a given subgraphId at any time, as long
 *          as their total amount remains more than minimumIndexingStakingAmount.
 * @req i07 An Indexer earns a portion of all fees from the settlement a channel they were
 *          involved in.
 *
 * Slashing Requirements
 * @req s01 The Dispute Manager contract can burn the staked Tokens of any Indexer.
 * @req s02 Only Governance can change the Dispute Manager contract address.
 * @reg s03 Only Governance can update slashingPercent.
 *
 * Fisherman Requirements
 * @req f01 A fisherman can provide a bond, a valid read request and an invalid read
 *          response which has been signed by a current indexing node to create a
 *          dispute.
 * @req f02 If the dispute is accepted by arbitration, the fisherman should receive a
 *          reward proportional to the amount staked by the indexing node.
 *
 * Dispute Arbitrator Requirements
 * @req a01 The arbitrator can rule to accept a proposed dispute, which will trigger a
 *          slashing of the indexing node that the dispute concerns.
 * @req a02 The arbitrator can rule to reject a proposed dispute, which will slash the
 *          bond posted by the fisherman who proposed it.
 *
 * @notice Dispute resolution is handled through an on-chain dispute resolution
 *         process. In the v1 specification the outcome of a dispute will be decided
 *         by a centralized arbitrator (the contract owner / multisig contract)
 *         interacting with the on-chain dispute resolution process.
 *
 * ----------------------------------- TODO This may change -------------------------------------
 * @notice Indexing Nodes who have staked for a dataset, are not limited by the protocol in how
 *         many read requests they may process for that dataset. However, it may be assumed that
 *         Indexing Nodes with higher deposits will receive more read requests and thus collect
 *         more fees, all else being equal, as this represents a greater economic security margin
 *         to the end user.
