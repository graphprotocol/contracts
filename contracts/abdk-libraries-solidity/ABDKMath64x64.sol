 * Smart contract library of mathematical functions operating with signed
 * 64.64-bit fixed point numbers.  Signed 64.64-bit fixed point number is
 * basically a simple fraction whose numerator is signed 128-bit integer and
 * denominator is 2^64.  As long as denominator is always the same, there is no
 * need to store it, thus in Solidity signed 64.64-bit fixed point numbers are
 * represented by int128 type holding only the numerator.
