/*
Right now, Graph Token is tested in its ERC-20 capabilities by the open zeppelin tests, since it is
part of that package

Then, our only added function, transferToTokenReceiver(), is testing in indexing.test.js and
curation.test.js.

So therefore, this file is blank for now, as a placeholder, to help make clear right now we are
okay with how much it is tested. We may add more tests here in the future.
