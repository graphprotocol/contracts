/**
 * @title L2GraphTokenLockManager
 * @notice This contract manages a list of authorized function calls and targets that can be called
 * by any TokenLockWallet contract and it is a factory of TokenLockWallet contracts.
 *
 * This contract receives funds to make the process of creating TokenLockWallet contracts
 * easier by distributing them the initial tokens to be managed.
 *
 * In particular, this L2 variant is designed to receive token lock wallets from L1,
 * through the GRT bridge. These transferred wallets will not allow releasing funds in L2 until
 * the end of the vesting timeline, but they can allow withdrawing funds back to L1 using
 * the L2GraphTokenLockTransferTool contract.
 *
 * The owner can setup a list of token destinations that will be used by TokenLock contracts to
 * approve the pulling of funds, this way in can be guaranteed that only protocol contracts
 * will manipulate users funds.
