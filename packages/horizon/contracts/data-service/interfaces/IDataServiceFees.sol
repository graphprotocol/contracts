 * @title Interface for the {DataServiceFees} contract.
 * @notice Extension for the {IDataService} contract to handle payment collateralization
 * using a Horizon provision.
 *
 * It's designed to be used with the Data Service framework:
 * - When a service provider collects payment with {IDataService.collect} the data service should lock
 *   stake to back the payment using {_lockStake}.
 * - Every time there is a payment collection with {IDataService.collect}, the data service should
 *   attempt to release any expired stake claims by calling {_releaseStake}.
 * - Stake claims can also be manually released by calling {releaseStake} directly.
 *
 * @dev Note that this implementation uses the entire provisioned stake as collateral for the payment.
 * It can be used to provide economic security for the payments collected as long as the provisioned
 * stake is not being used for other purposes.
