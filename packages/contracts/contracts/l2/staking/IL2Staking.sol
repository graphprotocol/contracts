 * @title Interface for the L2 Staking contract
 * @author Edge & Node
 * @notice This is the interface that should be used when interacting with the L2 Staking contract.
 * It extends the IStaking interface with the functions that are specific to L2, adding the callhook receiver
 * to receive transferred stake and delegation from L1.
 * @dev Note that L2Staking doesn't actually inherit this interface. This is because of
 * the custom setup of the Staking contract where part of the functionality is implemented
 * in a separate contract (StakingExtension) to which calls are delegated through the fallback function.
