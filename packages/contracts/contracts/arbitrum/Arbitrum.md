# Arbitrum contracts

These contracts have been copied from the [Arbitrum repo](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum).

They are also available as part of the npm packages [arb-bridge-eth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arb-bridge-eth) and [arb-bridge-peripherals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arb-bridge-peripherals). The reason for copying them rather than installing those packages is the contracts only support Solidity `^0.6.11`, so we had to change the version to `^0.7.6` for it to be compatible with our other contracts.
