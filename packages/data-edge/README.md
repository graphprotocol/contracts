# Data Edge

A DataEdge contract is used to store arbitrary data on-chain on any EVM compatible blockchain. A subgraph can then read all the calldata sent to a particular contract, decode it and update the subgraph state accordingly.

The DataEdge accepts any function call by using a fallback function that will not revert. It is up to the implementor to define the calldata format as well as how to decode it.

### Additional Considerations

- Fallback is not payable to avoid anyone sending ETH by mistake as the main purpose is to store calldata.

# Deploying

Setup a `.env` file with the keys you want to use for deployments. You can use `.env.sample` as a guide.
Deploy a `DataEdge` contract by running `pnpm deploy -- --network <network-name>`
