## Installation &amp; Deployment
1. Install Node.js `^11.0.0`
1. Run `npm install` at project root directory
1. Install and run `testrpc`, `ganache-cli`, or similar blockchain emulator
    - Configure to run on port `8545` or edit `truffle.js` to change the port used by Truffle
1. Install Truffle 5.0.0
    - `npm install -g truffle`
1. Truffle project commands
    - `truffle install` (installs ethPM dependencies)
    - `truffle compile` (compiles without deploying, local blockchain emulator not neccessary)
    - `truffle migrate [--reset] [--compile-all]` (deploys contracts to your local emulator or specified blockchain)
    - `truffle test` (runs tests)
1. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for instructions on deploying the contracts to the blockchain.

## Abstract
This repository will contain the Solidity smart contracts needed to facilitate the processes defined in the Product Requirements Document provided by The Graph.

## Requirement and Implementation Annotations
Each contract includes docstring-like comments with requirements listed at the top of the file. 

Example: `@req c01 Any User can stake Graph Tokens to be included as a Curator for a given subgraphId.`

Explanation: The `c01` denotes a section and number for the requirement. `c` in this case stands for `curation` and later in the contract we see `@req s01` used for a `staking` requirement.

Farther down in the code you should see annotations for the implementation of each requirement written as `@imp c01` (and so on). This is meant to be a simple way of defining and matching requirements and their implementations.
