[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum, IPFS, Polygon, and other blockchains. Anyone can build and Publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

## Packages

This repository is a Yarn workspaces monorepo containing the following packages:

| Package | Latest version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [contracts](./packages/contracts) | [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fcontracts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fcontracts) | Contracts enabling the open and permissionless decentralized network known as The Graph protocol. |
| [token-distribution](./packages/token-distribution) | - | Contracts managing token locks for network participants |
| [sdk](./packages/sdk) | [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fsdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fsdk) | TypeScript based SDK to interact with the protocol contracts |


## Development

### Setup
To set up this project you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Note that Yarn v4 is required to install the dependencies and build the project. 

From your command line:

```bash
# Enable Yarn v4
corepack enable
yarn set version stable

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts

# Go into the repository
$ cd contracts

# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Build projects
$ yarn build
```

### Versioning and publishing packages

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage package versioning, this ensures that all packages are versioned together in a consistent manner and helps with generating changelogs.

#### Step 1: Creating a changeset

A changeset is a file that describes the changes that have been made to the packages in the repository. To create a changeset, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
$ yarn changeset
```

Changeset files are stored in the `.changeset` directory until they are packaged into a release. You can commit these files and even merge them into your main branch without publishing a release.

#### Step 2: Creating a package release

When you are ready to create a new package release, run the following command to package all changesets, this will also bump package versions and dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn changeset version
```

### Step 3: Tagging the release

__Note__: this step is meant to be run on the main branch.

After creating a package release, you will need to tag the release commit with the version number. To do this, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
$ yarn changeset tag
$ git push --follow-tags
```

#### Step 4: Publishing a package release

__Note__: this step is meant to be run on the main branch.

Packages are published and distributed via NPM. To publish a package, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
# Publish the package
$ yarn npm publish --access public --tag <tag>
```

Alternatively, there is a GitHub action that can be manually triggered to publish a package.

## Documentation

> Coming soon

For now, each package has its own README with more specific documentation you can check out.
