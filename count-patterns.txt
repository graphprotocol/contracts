# Pattern file for count-specified-changes script
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored
# Lines starting with ! are exclude patterns
# All other lines are include patterns
# Patterns use standard bash glob syntax and match against full file paths

# Include patterns (files to count):
packages/issuance/contracts/**/*.sol
packages/contracts/contracts/rewards/RewardsManager*.sol
packages/common/contracts/**/*.sol

# Exclude patterns (files to ignore):
!*/mocks/*.sol
!*/tests/*.sol
!*Mock*.sol
!*Test.sol
!*.t.sol

!packages/contracts/contracts/!(rewards)/*.sol
!**/@(IGraphToken|SubgraphAvailabilityManager).sol

# Glob pattern examples:
# *.sol                           - matches any .sol file in repo root
# packages/*/contracts/*.sol      - matches .sol files in any package's contracts dir
# packages/issuance/**/*.sol      - matches .sol files anywhere under issuance package
# **/GraphToken.sol               - matches GraphToken.sol anywhere in the repo
# !**/Mock*.sol                   - excludes any file starting with "Mock"
# !packages/*/contracts/test/**   - excludes test directories in contracts
